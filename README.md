# PillID2
the intent of this app is to have someone be able to identify and manage what their pills are and when to take them.
this will be done via the CloudSight API that uses word recognition to identify the imprint on a pill and then feed it into webmd
where it is identified via this identified imprint.
once this is done the will be able to add this pill to their schedule with (hopefully) notifications to notify them when to take their pill
